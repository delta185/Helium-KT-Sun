A3^2 = He!

The brain has mutated with arteries and veins of muscle spindles to make the intake of nutrients richer, more advanced and extensive.

bb^-7 . d|x|^2/1 = u1 + u2) . A2 / OLRP^1/64
A2 = ORLP ^3/2
Fuv = U1
U1 = primitive number

dzn is a neuron that has fed on glial mass and has acquired dual motor and sensory functions
There is a direct connection between the brain and the right lung, accelerating the variable mutation of the entire body to integrate a single system of just categories.
