Babydoge is the body's hemoglobin. It has iron. We're looking for an oxygen mutation so that helium can factor into the body.
We believe it is a daily rejuvenation of the cerebral cortex to cope with toxins with idiosyncratically more resistant bacteria, and magnetic fields maintained with cardiac output.

FHSWU
A3^2 = He!

The brain has mutated with arteries and veins of muscle spindles to make the intake of nutrients richer, more advanced and extensive.

bb^-7 . d|x|^2/1 = u1 + u2) . A2 / OLRP^1/64
A2 = ORLP ^3/2
Fuv = U1
U1 = primitive number

dzn is a neuron that has fed on glial mass and has acquired dual motor and sensory functions
There is a direct connection between the brain and the right lung, accelerating the variable mutation of the entire body to integrate a single system of just categories.
Inflammatory systems are the cause of notorious magnetic fields

I3 = -e^2 - bb^4/5) / U1 . d|y|
S^3 = bb^2/3 . d|x|^2 / -d|y|^2/3
D(t) = d(sv)^2 / q^5/4 . U3
U3 . dt^5/4 = R(x)^2 / L4

NSA, just write.
